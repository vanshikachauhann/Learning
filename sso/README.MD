# SSO(Single sign on)
It is an authentication method where a user logs in once and gets access to multiple applications or systems without logging in again and again.

#   How SSO Works (Simple Flow)

     * User tries to open an application
     * User logs in once
     * Server verifies identity
     * Server sends a trust token back to apps
     * User can now access all connected apps

# Advantages of SSO

            * Only one login needed
            * Saves time
            * Better user experience
            * Fewer passwords to remember
            * Centralized security control
            * Easy for companies to manage users

# Disadvantages of SSO

    1️⃣ Single Point of Failure
    If the SSO server goes down, users cannot log in to any connected applications.
    
    2️⃣ High Risk if Account is Compromised
    If someone hacks the SSO login, they can access all linked systems, not just one.
    
    3️⃣ Setup is Complex
    Implementing SSO in an organization needs proper configuration and technical knowledge.
    
    4️⃣ Higher Initial Cost
    Enterprise SSO solutions may cost money to set up and maintain.
    
    5️⃣ Dependency on Central System
    All apps depend on one identity provider — if it has issues, everything is affected.
    
    6️⃣ Needs Strong Security Controls
    SSO must use MFA (multi-factor authentication). Without it, security risk increases.
