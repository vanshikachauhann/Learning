# SSO(Single sign on)
It is an authentication method where a user logs in once and gets access to multiple applications or systems without logging in again and again.

#   How SSO Works (Simple Flow)

     * User tries to open an application
     * User logs in once<br>
     * Server verifies identity<br>
     * Server sends a trust token back to apps<br>
     * User can now access all connected apps<br>
